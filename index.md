I am an evolutionary biologist with a special interest in host-virus interactions in complex communities. I am particularly interested in how biotic and abiotic factors interact to influence these complex multi-host, multi-virus communities. The effects of this include their composition (the insect ‘virome’), its consistency over both ecological and evolutionary timescales (eg. seasonal prevalence variation and host switching), and the resulting selection pressure exerted on both the host and virus genomes. Beyond my scientific interests, I love a wee run, a game of rugby, good coffee, and great gin. 
  
I conducted research towards my PhD in evolutionary biology from the University of Edinburgh in the lab of [Darren Obbard](https://obbard.bio.ed.ac.uk/index.html). My PhD thesis focussed on demonstrating the utility of the model species Drosophila melanogaster, and other sympatric Drosophila species, as a model for examining insect virus co-evolution in a realistic wild context. This first involved using metagenomic sequencing to describe novel Drosophila-associated RNA viruses. I then characterised variation in the prevalence and host range of both new and known Drosophila viruses using spatiotemporally structured sampling in the wild. This kind of data allows us to ask what environmental and phylogenetic factors determine viral host range, and prevalence. I also analysed the diversity, and spatiotemporal patterns of prevalence seen in DNA viruses infecting European populations of Drosophila. Prior to my PhD, I received an MRes in Ecology and Environmental Biology from the University of Glasgow, where I worked with [Roman Biek](https://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/bahcm/staff/romanbiek/), [Daniel Streicker](https://streickerlab.com/), and [Maude Jacquot](https://spell.ulb.be/person/maude-jacquot/), to investigate the factors which determine the frequency of Rabies virus host shifts. 

As of April 2021, I am working as a postdoc with [Ben Longdon](https://benlongdon.com/) at the University of Exeter. As part of my postdoc, I will again be utilising multiple Drosophila species to ask questions about viral host range, and the evolution of virulence. However, I will be utilising a panel of Drosophila species in the lab to examine the host specificity of one of the mechanisms which might underlie viral virulence and onward transmission: viral suppression of the host immune response.
