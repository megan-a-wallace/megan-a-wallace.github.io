I am an evolutionary biologist with a special interest in host-virus interactions in complex communities. I am working as a postdoc with [Ben Longdon](https://benlongdon.com/), using cryo-electron tomography of focused ion beam-thinned cells to quantify mitochondrial morphology and solve _in situ_ protein structures. In particular, I am excited about the power of electron tomography to contextualize the structure, dynamics, and interactions of proteins as they perform their physiolocal function in the cell.    
I received my PhD in evolutionary biology from the University of Edinburgh in the lab of [Darren Obbard](https://obbard.bio.ed.ac.uk/index.html), where I developed methods for the building and validating atomic models generated from single particle electron microscopy, as well as investigating the mechanisms of activity of mammalian chitinases. Before that, I received an MRes in Ecology and Environmental Biology from the University of Glasgow, where I worked with [Roman Biek], [Daniel Streicker], and [Maude Jacquot], where I worked with [Elizabeth Sattely](http://www.stanford.edu/group/sattelygroup/cgi-bin/wordpress/) investigating bacterial degradation of the plant polymer lignin.   
Beyond my scientific interests, I love a wee run, a game of rugby, good coffee, and great gin.
